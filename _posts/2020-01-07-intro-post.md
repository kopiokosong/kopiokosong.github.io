My standard order is a kopi-o kosong dit lou. 
Black coffee with no water added to dilute it. The thickest form of kopitiam coffee available. 

I do not call myself a coffee connoisseur. I would not spend money on over-priced drinks. However, I drink coffee frequently enough that my coffee order quite fairly well defines me (and makes me sound older than what I truly am).
