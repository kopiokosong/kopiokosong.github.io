I do not call myself a coffee connoisseur. While I would not spend money on over-priced drinks, I drink it frequently enough that my coffee order quite fairly well defines me (and makes me sound older than what I truly am). 

My standard order is a kopi-o kosong **dit lou**.
Black coffee with no water added to dilute it. The thickest form of kopitiam coffee available.

### Please do not ask me what kind of beans I use because I do not care.
